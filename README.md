## Installing Coder dojo Guatemala
this is the development mode for this project, we are using Express and node.js so recommend to install Node enviroment first and then your express application, we gonna explain in the next section how for those that are working for the first time in node environment.

## Installing node
You need the nodejs environment in your system, because we are using express and the server was built it with nodes, so sit tight if you want to install it in your computer:

Depending on your system if you are using Windows, Linux or Macos visit the core foundation first [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and donwload it.

## Making the route
So after installed NodeJs Environment you might to create the route of the project, this is very simple, create a new folder whatever you want in your computer and then install Exprees there just like this:
  > C:\users\yourSystem\Documents\NodesProjects\myApplication
  
## Installing Express
