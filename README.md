# coder dojo guatemala
This is a programming club where we are going to post not only tutorials and robotics projects but also how to develop websites, games and R or Neo4j language. For those who want to take your skills to the next level.

Right now we are working of the development website, its design and its templates, willing to improve this first version.

## Installing Coder dojo Guatemala
this is the development mode for this project, we are using Express and node.js, We recommend to install Node enviroment first and then your express application, we gonna explain in the next section how for those that are working for the first time in node environment.

## Installing node
You need the nodejs environment in your system, because we are using express and the server was built it with nodes, so sit tight if you want to install it in your computer:

Depending on your system if you are using Windows, Linux or Macos visit the core foundation first [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and donwload it.

## Making the route
So after installed NodeJs Environment you might to create the route of the project, this is very simple, create a new folder whatever you want in your computer and then install Exprees there just like this:
  > C:\users\yourSystem\Documents\NodesProjects\myApplication
  
## Installing Express
I will explain the same like in [ExpressJS.com](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) but remember you must to be in your route like in the step before:
  > $ mkdir yournewapp <br>
  > $ cd yournewapp <br>
  > $ npm init <br>
  > $ entry point(index.js) <br>

After this pint you should have a packaje.json for now make DEFAULT everything and the we gonna install express in the same directory of your application
  > $ npm install express --save <br>
  > $ npm install express --save jquery <br>

We suggest to make the express Generator but you can clone this repository to the directory that you are using right now for this project, because we alredy made all the steps before, but we might know that you must to install express, nodeJs and jQuery in your computer

If you have all the enviroments and module that we say before, just clone the repository and paste it in your directory.

## Run the server using Node
after you complete the steps to install the project you can run the server in your computer and modify, how to make this:
  > being in your directory <br>
  > \myapplication set DEBUG=myapplication:* & npm start <br>
  > The server is listening on port 1703 <br>
  
then go and check in your browser and type localhost:1703
